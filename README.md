# safetrees.sol
A decentralized eco-friendly community where TREES token holders earn passive rewards and ultimately supports environment-centred projects.
The mechanism employs a pay-to-grow-tend-track-model, which allows app users to measure real tree attributes and get an equivalent TREES token value for the CO2 the tree absorbed as a carbon offset. TREES token can be bought and held as an asset, or burnt to offset an individual's carbon footprint.
